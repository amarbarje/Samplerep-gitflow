git clone "clone url" to create github rep locally
git checkout -b samplebranch
add a file locally to Samplerep repository
cd samplebranch -- Navigate to Samplebranch
git status
git add . - File is now staged in sample branch
git commit -m "first commit on sample branch"
git push -u origin Samplebranch - creates a branch in github with name Samplebranch
New pull Request>Create pull request button on Github
Check the direction of Master and Sample branch
Add comments and review. Pull requests pull the changes from Samplebranch to Master branch
Click confirm merge to merge changes to 'Master'
Come back to Local repository on desktop
cd Samplerep (master)
To switch between branches - git checkout branchname
git fetch - to pull files but merge manually
or
git pull - to pull files and merge automatically
